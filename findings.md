## Documented Findings:

### Vulnerabilities and Risks Identified:

- Identified vulnerabilities include lack of input validation and sanitization, potential CSRF vulnerabilities, and insecure authentication mechanisms.
- Weaknesses in authentication mechanism, such as hardcoded credentials, pose risks of unauthorized access and credential compromise.

### Impact and Risks:

- Without proper input validation and sanitization, the application is vulnerable to injection attacks, such as SQL injection and XSS, which could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access.
- Insecure authentication mechanisms increase the risk of credential compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
- Potential CSRF vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.

### Code Fixes and Enhancements:

#### Input Validation and Sanitization:

- Implemented input validation and sanitization using express-validator for all user input fields to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Applied proper validation rules and sanitization methods to validate and sanitize user inputs, including username and password fields in the login form.

#### Secure Authentication and Authorization:

- Implemented CSRF protection to validate CSRF tokens on sensitive routes, preventing CSRF attacks and ensuring the integrity of requests.
- Enhance authentication mechanism by implementing proper password handling techniques (e.g., password hashing) to securely store passwords and mitigate the risk of credential compromise.
